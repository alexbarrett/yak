# Yak

Yak is a lightweight chat server and web client. Slack and Discord are great,
but not open source and difficult to extend with custom functionality.

Currently this is just a prototype to experiment with [Koa][koa] and
[Socket.IO][io]. Basic features like keeping a message history and multiple
chats are not implemented.

The main goal for this project is to be highly extensible (both client- and
server-side) while keeping the core as minimal and lightweight as possible.
