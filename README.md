# Yak

Yak exists because Slack isn't quite what I want.

## Desired features

  - Message history (!)
  - Multiple channels / private messages
  - Unfurl links / images
  - Highly extendable / plugin based
    - Text format plugins (even Markdown is a plugin)
    - Identity is a plugin and optional; without it Yak is fully anonymous
    - Server- and client-side plugins
  - Mobile notifications (service worker?)
